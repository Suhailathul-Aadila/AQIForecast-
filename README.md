#Air Quality Index Forecasting and Visual Analytics for major Indian cities using CNN-LSTM Models

This project uses deep learning to analyse and model Air Quality Index (AQI) data across various Indian cities. The work includes AQI forecasting, temporal pattern learning per city, clustering based on LSTM embeddings, and visualizing monthly trends by city cluster.

üîç Project Objectives
‚Ä¢	AQI Forecasting: Predict future AQI values using historical time-series data.
‚Ä¢	City-wise Pattern Modelling: Use LSTM and CNN-LSTM models to learn pollution patterns for different cities.
‚Ä¢	City Clustering: Group cities with similar AQI temporal behaviour using LSTM embeddings and clustering (K-Means).
‚Ä¢	Seasonal Trend Analysis: Plot average AQI patterns by month for each cluster of cities.
